# SIMP: Long-Term Indoor Localization with Metric-Semantic Mapping using a Floor Plan Prior
 This repository contains the implementation of the following publication:


## Overview
We provide a long-term localization system and a metric-semantic mapping pipeline, both utilizing 3D object detection. 
We enhance a floor plan map with knowledge about objects, contributing to the robustness of the localization and enabling more complex tasks such as navigation and manipulation.

Our live demos for both localization and mapping on the Dingo-O platform can seen in the following video:
